## The Gameplay Split

- Shoot cosmic horrors with 1920s weapons (rifles, shotguns, pistols)
- Manage ammo and resources
- Tactical positioning, aim skill matters
- Guns feel adequate and functional (not exceptional)

**30% Class Abilities**
- Deploy signature abilities (turrets, shields, healing, pulls)
- Team synergy through ability combos
- Strategic timing creates memorable moments
- Each class feels totally different

**10% Equipment**
- Grenades, traps, utility items
- Supplements core gameplay

---

## The Four Classes

**No duplicate classes allowed in a team.**

### Bulwark (Tank)
- **Role:** Absorb damage, control chokepoints
- **Fantasy:** Coast Guard officer with riot shield and reality anchor
- **Playstyle:** Plant shields and anchor zones, tank for team

### Lamplighter (Scout)
- **Role:** Reveal enemies, boost mobility
- **Fantasy:** Field researcher with flare gun and speed-boost marks
- **Playstyle:** Scout ahead, light areas, reveal threats, reposition fast

### Harpooner (Aggressive Control)
- **Role:** Pull priority targets, melee combat
- **Fantasy:** Whaling ship harpooner with pull mechanics and frenzy
- **Playstyle:** Pull enemies into kill zones, aggressive melee rushes

### Occultist (Support)
- **Role:** Heal teammates, reduce corruption
- **Fantasy:** Spiritualist with healing circles and corruption purge
- **Playstyle:** Keep team healthy, manage Breach Saturation, provide shields

**All classes can use any weapon. Class identity comes from abilities, not weapons.**

---

## Shared Weapon Pool (8 Weapons)

**Tier 1 (Free):** M1903 Springfield, Double-Barrel Shotgun, .38 Revolver  
**Tier 2 (800-1,200 scrip):** Winchester 1897, M1911 Pistol, Lee-Enfield  
**Tier 3 (2,000-3,000 scrip):** Thompson SMG, BAR  
**Tier 4 (5,000+ scrip):** Elephant Gun, Blessed Rounds

Unlock weapons with currency earned from extractions.

---

## The Breach Saturation System

**What:** Reality corruption meter that increases over time  
**Why:** Creates escalating pressure without artificial timer

**Increases from:**
- Killing enemies
- Time in zone
- Loud actions

**Decreases from:**
- Closing reality rifts
- Occultist's Purge Corruption ability

**Effects by Level:**
- **0-25% (Green):** Normal fog, predictable spawns
- **25-50% (Yellow):** Ambush spawns, audio hallucinations
- **50-75% (Orange):** Hunter enemies, coordinated AI, hazards activate
- **75-100% (Red):** Boss enemies spawn, continuous pressure, extraction penalty

**Strategic Choice:**
- Stealth = slower but safer (low saturation)
- Aggression = faster but riskier (high saturation)

---

## Extraction Points (Risk vs. Reward)

**1. The Shallows (1× Multiplier)**
- Beach rowboat extraction
- 15-second channel
- Safe but minimal rewards

**2. The Lighthouse (2× Multiplier)**
- Must light beacon to signal pickup
- Attracts enemy swarms
- Medium risk, good rewards

**3. The Drowned Cathedral (3× Multiplier)**
- Boss arena, flooded church
- 60-second extraction ritual
- Highest risk, best rewards + boss loot

**Formula:** Total Scrip = (Loot Collected) × (Extraction Multiplier) × (Contract Bonus)

---

## Progression System (Two Tracks)

### Track 1: Weapons (Scrip Currency)
- Extract with loot → Earn scrip
- Spend scrip → Unlock better weapons
- Weapons shared across ALL classes

### Track 2: Abilities (Class XP + Scrip)
- Extract successfully → Earn class XP
- Level 5 → Unlock Tier 2 ability upgrades
- Level 10 → Unlock Tier 3 ability upgrades
- Spend scrip + XP → Improve abilities
- **Per class** (must level each separately)

**Result:** Two progression paths encourage both experimentation (try all classes) and mastery (max out favorite).

---

## The Setting: Tide's End, Massachusetts (1924)

**Location:** Fictional New England coastal town  
**Event:** The Breach (1923) - Failed ritual tore reality, creating permanent breach zones  
**Cover Story:** "Tuberculosis outbreak" (government quarantine)  
**Reality:** Arkwright Institute (think Miskatonic University's militant division) recruits specialists to contain eldritch horrors

**Key Locations:**
- Rotting fishing villages
- Abandoned whaling stations
- Stone lighthouses (ritual sites)
- Half-sunken ships
- Rocky tide pools
- Fog-choked forests

**Atmosphere:**
- Cold blues, grays, seafoam greens
- Heavy maritime fog
- Perpetual twilight (Breach blocks sun)
- Bioluminescent enemies
- Crashing waves, creaking wood, distant foghorns

---

## What Makes This Unique?

**vs. Hunt: Showdown:**
- Pure PvE (no PvP toxicity/cheaters)
- Class abilities (not just gunplay)
- New England coast (not Louisiana bayou)
- Lovecraftian (not Southern Gothic)

**vs. Deep Rock Galactic:**
- Extraction mechanics (not mining)
- Hand-crafted maps (not procedural caves)
- Gothic horror (not whimsical dwarves)
- Ammo scarcity (not infinite resupply)

**vs. Helldivers 2:**
- Extraction gameplay (not mission-based)
- Gothic horror extraction (not sci-fi bugs)
- 30-min sessions (not 15-min missions)
- Class abilities + guns (similar hybrid)

**The Gap We Fill:**
Nobody is making class-based PvE Lovecraftian extraction shooters. We're combining proven genres in a unique setting.

---

## Target Audience

**Primary:**
- Deep Rock Galactic players wanting horror extraction
- Hunt: Showdown players wanting co-op without PvP
- Helldivers 2 players wanting gothic horror setting

**Secondary:**

## Key Design Principles

1. **Guns deal damage, abilities create opportunities**
   - No pure ability spam
   - Abilities enable gunplay, don't replace it

2. **Team composition matters**
   - No duplicate classes allowed
   - Each class brings unique value
   - Solo is hard, team synergy is rewarded

3. **Every shot matters**
   - Ammo scarcity creates tension
   - Conservative shooting is rewarded
   - Headshots matter (2× damage)

4. **Simple AI, complex scenarios**
   - Basic enemy state machines
   - Variety and combinations create tactics
   - Breach Saturation changes behavior

5. **Achievable scope**
   - 8 weapons (not 20)
   - 8 abilities (2 per class)
   - Hand-crafted map (not procedural)
   - 18-month timeline realistic

## The Elevator Pitch (You're In an Elevator)

**Version 1 (To Gamers):**
"It's like Deep Rock Galactic's class-based co-op, but you're extracting artifacts from Lovecraftian New England instead of mining. Think Hunt: Showdown's tension but without the PvP toxicity."

**Version 2 (To Investors):**
"Class-based PvE extraction shooter in the Lovecraftian horror space. Filling the gap between Deep Rock Galactic and Hunt: Showdown. Target: 10K+ sales in Early Access at $25. Achievable scope for solo/small team."

**Version 3 (To Players Tired of PvP):**
"Finally, an extraction shooter without cheaters or PvP toxicity. Pure co-op teamwork, choosing your class and working together to survive. Nobody can ruin your run except bad decisions and eldritch horrors."
